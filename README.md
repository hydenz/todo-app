## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - Web API to store client side data
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I learned about [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) which is a performant, clean and powerful API to handle Drag and Drop gestures

### Continued development

It's my first time using Styled Components, and I liked it's philosophy so much, that I intend to use it in most of my future projects

### Useful resources

- [react-beautiful-dnd free course](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) - This helped me to get started on the library in few minutes.
- [Use Local Storage React Hook](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/) - This is an amazing custom React Hook that helped me to manage browser's local storage.
- [Styled Components Docs](https://styled-components.com/docs) - The library's docs is very clear and straight
