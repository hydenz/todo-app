## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Local Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - Web API to store client side data
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A Javascript library for building user interfaces
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - CSS in JS
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript
- [react-transition-group](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) - React Transitions made easy

### What I learned

In this project, I learned about [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) which is a performant, clean and powerful API to handle Drag and Drop gestures

### Continued development

It's my first time using Styled Components, and I liked it's philosophy so much, that I intend to use it in most of my future projects

### Useful resources

- [react-beautiful-dnd free course](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) - This helped me to get started on the library in few minutes.
- [Use Local Storage React Hook](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/) - This is an amazing custom React Hook that helped me to manage browser's local storage.
- [Styled Components Docs](https://styled-components.com/docs) - The library's docs is very clear and straight
